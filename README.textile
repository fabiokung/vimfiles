h1. Vim

It is recommended that you use gVim in either Windows or Linux and MacVim for
Mac. Download from:

* (Windows) http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc (gvim72.exe)
* (Mac) http://code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list (snapshot-52)

A nice terminal based option for Debian based distributions is the **vim-full** package:

bc. apt-get install vim-full

h1. Usage

Clone this repo into your home directory either as .vim (linux/mac) or 
vimfiles (Windows):

bc. git clone git://github.com/fabiokung/vimfiles.git ~/.vim

Then 'cd' into the repo and run this to get all bundles:

bc. git submodule update --init

The ~/.vim/vimrc file needs to be loaded:

bc. echo "runtime vimrc" > ~/.vimrc

h2. Help Tags

At first usage of vim, type ":" while in command mode and execute:

  call pathogen#helptags()

This will make the plugins documentations available upon :help

h2. Dependencies

You will need these dependencies figured out:

* Exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net/)
* Ncurses-term (in Linux only), or better vim-full on some Debian based distros

In Ubuntu, for example, you will have to do:

bc. apt-get install exuberant-ctags ncurses-term

On Windows you have to download Ctags and add ctags.exe in your PATH.
